/**
 * Minor comment on functional programming
 * A parser (esp. a compiler) is a type of program that can be a pure function.
 * This implementation doesn't look like that; we see an assignment in the very
 * first line. But that said, it needn't. What we need to see there, as what this
 * program could really be doing, is threading that argument through a series of fns,
 * the first of which would be skipSpace. This kind of thinking is better done in
 * languages other than javascript, though, which have cleaner syntax for doing that.
 */

/**
 * parseExpression
 * In Egg, expressions are separated by (any amount of) whitespace. So, first, we skip
 * all leading whitespace so we can be sure an expr begins at index 0 of the prog string.
 * At 1, 2 & 3 we match valid expressions in the language & create the corresponding
 * data structure for the matched expression.
 * _regex reminders_  ^ is start of line; [] is character class, () is matched group.
 * 1st regex: match a dble quoted thing cont. char class not dbl quotes.
 * 2nd regex: match any num decimals followed by word boundary
 * 3rd regex: match any seq of neg. defined char class.
 *            excl: white space,bracket, comma, space char, hash, dbl quote.
 * Qu: why does 1st regex also match zero, i.e. ""
 * Qu: why does 1st regex use match[1] & others match[0] (a typo?) -WORKS WITH EITHER!-
 * Qu: why does 2nd regex require a word boundary \b & others dont.
 * Note: 3rd also catches number value, but 2nd regex will have caught it prior.
 * At this point, the function can be tested by simply returning expr.
 * Then, to add the rest of our program, we return the return value of the function
 * parseApply(), -this will be _mutual recursion_-, with the formed expr as its first
 * argument. The second argument is the remainder of the unparsed program string.
